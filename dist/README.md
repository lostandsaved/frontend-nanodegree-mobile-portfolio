## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

## Usage



## Summary of My Optimizations

### Images

I used GIMP to resize the images and Google Analytics or https://tinypng.com/ for the compression.

### index.html

* Added the style from  /style.css directly to the page
* Moved the Analytics script to the bottom of page
* Added media="print" to print.css.
* Used a compressed version of img/profilepic.jpg
* Used/referenced to a smaller/compressed version of pizzeria.jpg (pizzeria-small.jpg)

### views/pizza.html

* Added style from views/css/style.css directly to the page.
* Moved the reference to css/bootstrap-grid.css to the bottom of the page.
* Used a smaller/compressed version of pizza.png.

### views/js/main

* Used the method learned in class to rewrite the "changePizzaSizes" function. This removes the querySelectors from the loop and only resizes the pizzas based on the size chosen by the slider
* Updated the "updatePositions" function to use "getElementsByClassName" instead of "querySelector", this offered a slight improvement
* Created a variable, "pageTop", and I am calculating this outside of the loop since it only needs to be calculated once, and then I am using it in the "phase" variable creation.

## Description of project requirements

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
